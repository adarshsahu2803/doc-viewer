Easily navigate through multi-page documents. Whether your document has 5 pages or more, you can jump to any specific page with ease.

### 2. Rotate
Rotate your document by 90 degrees, either clockwise or anticlockwise, to suit your preferred orientation.

### 3. Zoom In/Out
Adjust the zoom level to get a closer or wider view of your document. Zoom in for detailed inspection or zoom out for a broader overview.

### 4. Print
Utilize the browser's printing option to create a hard copy of the document. Customize print settings as needed for optimal results.

### 5. Download
Download the document with a personalized filename. When clicking on the download button, you'll be prompted to enter the desired name, ensuring the downloaded file reflects your chosen identifier.

### 6. Text Search
Efficiently search for specific keywords within the document. The text search feature makes it easy to locate and navigate to relevant content.
